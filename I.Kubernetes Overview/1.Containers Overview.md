# Containers Overview

To learn k8s, you need to know what is Container and Orchestration

## Why need container
- It's not easy to maintain compatibility between package and underlying system (libraries, OS, hardware, dependencies etc.)
- We can't guarantee the application run in the same way in different environments (dev, staging, production)
- When new developers onboarding, sometime it's very complex to setup development environment
- With container, we can run applications in separate environment, with it own dependencies, libraries... all on the same VM/OS/Hardware

## What is container
- Container is completely isolated environment, they can have their own processes, networking interfaces, their own mounts just like VM except they're shared the same operating system kernel
  - OS is consist of two things: OS Kernel and a set of software on top of it.
  - Because of all linux variants are using same linux kernel, so container management tool (like Docker) can ultilize the kernel and run different linux variant containers on top of it. (eg. underlying is Ubuntu, you can using docker to run debian, fedora, opensuse etc.. containers on top of it), and this is the reason that windows container cannot run on Linux system.
- Main purpose of container is to packaging applications, ship them and run them
- Container vs Virtual Machine
  - Container(Application/Libs/Deps) <-> Docker <-> OS <-> Hardware
  - Virtual machines(Application/Libs/Deps + OS itself) <-> Hypervisor <-> OS <-> Hardware
  - The OS of the VM make it heavy, much overhead than container. 
  - You can run both Linux and Windows on the same hypervisor which is impossible to do it with container
- Image is a template. You can create multiple containers from one image.
